Prologue: The Elder Prince[X]

## Ch0ButterflyIntro

Imagine a butterfly.[AN]
Imagine its wings, the purest[n]
white. The Highlands. A holy place.[AN]
Now, as it lands upon a flower, you[n]
see the backs of its wings are a deep[n]
black. The Lowlands. A feared place.[AN]
The butterfly can never see the backs[n]
of its wings. It can only hear of them,[n]
think of them, and imagine what they[n]
are.[A][X]

## Ch0HighlandsLore

Two hundred years ago, I am told,[n]
the first Highlanders sought refuge[n]
in these mountains, and made them[n]
their home.[AN]
Thus, the Highlands were born.[AN]
Every generation since fought[n]
bitterly for our existence in these[n]
lands. Larger nations besieged us[n]
in the east, but we would not yield.[AN]
I served under our sixth ruler.[n]
As he neared the end of[n]
his life, a semblance of peace[n]
had finally come to us.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Teacher! Couldn't have asked[N]
for a better visitor.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
And I brought a present.[....][N]
Happy birthday, my friend.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Oho![....] Snuck that past the curates,[N]
did you?[....] How I missed fine wine...[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
How do you feel, old dog?[....][N]
Hanging in there?[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Your son worries after you.[AN]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
I'm happy.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Your illness--[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Yes, yes.[....] I know what you meant.[....][n]
But this is more important.[AN]
I may spend half the day in bed, but[n]
I'm happy.[....] Happier than I've ever been.[AN]
My lands are in order.[....] The war wanes.[....][n]
My son makes me prouder each day.[AN]
The Highlands are grasping at peace.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
How much time is left in you,[n]
do you think?[AN]

[mr]
...Hm.[....] Some weeks, perhaps.[AN]

[ml]
...[AN]

[mr]
Don't make that face.[AN]
The illness and the pain may claim me,[n]
but so what?[AN]
They claim all men, at the end of things.[AN]

[ml]
Yes.[....] It's just...[....] weeks.[....][AN]
I can't imagine my restlessness,[n]
if it were me.[A]

[mr][ToggleSmile]
Restless?[....] You?[....] Hahaha![AN]

[ml][ToggleSmile]
What's so funny?[AN]

[mr][ToggleSmile]
How long have you served me, fool?[....][n]
O, Silver General?[....] Thirty years?[AN]

[ml][ToggleSmile]
Forty, nearly.[....] Since I was a boy.[....] Why?[AN]

[mr][ToggleSmile]
Why haven't you left me, then, if[n]
you're so restless?[AN]

[ml][ToggleSmile]
Why haven't I left you?[....] What's this,[n]
all of a sudden?[AN]
Loyalty, milord. I could never desert the[n]
men.[....] Your son.[....] You.[AN]

[mr][ToggleSmile]
Heh.[....] That's a coward's answer.[AN]

[ml][ToggleSmile]
Harsh words![AN]

[mr][ToggleSmile]
By royal decree, I hereby command you...[n]
to think on it.[AN]
Write, even. Start a journal, why don't[n]
you?[AN]

[ml][ToggleSmile]
...I can't tell if I'm meant to laugh or--[AN]

[mr][ToggleSmile]
I'm serious![....] You have your orders,[n]
soldier; off to the study with you![AN][CloseSpeechSlow]

[ml][MoveFarLeft]
Alright, alright![AN]

[mr]
Wait![....] One last order for you.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]

[fl][MoveMidLeft][ml]
What is it?[AN]

[mr]
In the coming weeks, I want you to take[n]
me to the Lowlands.[....][n]
I'd like to see them, at the end of my life.[AN]

[ml]
What?[....] What's to be seen[N]
in a place like that?[AN]

[mr]
I dream about that place.[AN]
A truth about myself shall be[N]
revealed, I feel.[AN]
Whatever it is, I want you and my son[N]
to see it, too.[A][X]

## Ch0LowlandBrownBox
Lowlands Edge[X]


## Ch0LowlandLore

Beside the Highlands, at the corner[n]
of the earth, lied the Lowlands.[n]
Two hundred years had taught us[n]
little about them.[AN]
Some said they were the last vestige[n]
of untamed creation, and the great[n]
beasts remained there as they had[n]
been at the dawn of time.[AN]
Some said that the deep valleys were[n]
passages to the land of the dead.[AN]
We knew only that the Lowlands were[n]
an ancient place, inhabited by things[n]
seen only in dreams. Fearsome things.[AN]
And humans were not welcome there.[A][X]


## Ch0LowlandsArrival

[ml][LoadYoungTeacher]
[mr][LoadOldPrince]

[ml]
We've arrived, sire.[....] But the fog...[AN]
There's no telling what manner of[n]
creatures hide in it.[AN]

[mr]
Yes, they say these hills crawl with[n]
all manner of fearsome things.[AN]
Fear, fear...[AN]
Never fear, my friend.[....] Our promising[n]
successors will repel whatever comes.[A]
That blue-haired boy...[....] Why, he's the[n]
moppet you plucked from obscurity,[AN]
isn't he?[AN]

[ml]
Indeed.[.....] He defeated my brother on[n]
the chessboard when he was eight.[AN]
Your son is just as brilliant, but...[AN]

[mr]
But what?[an]

[ml]
...They're young, sire.[....] Very young.[....][n]
Is your son prepared, do you think?[AN]

[mr]
And so was I.[....] So were you.[AN]
We live in a harsh land, full of children[n]
raised by children.[AN]

[ml]
A morbid truth.[AN]
...We're still young inside, too, aren't we?[AN]

[mr]
Exactly.[....] And that's why you must go![....][n]
I won't have you die restless, my friend.[AN]
I want you to feel how I feel now, when[n]
the end comes.[AN]
Let it be the final debt I owe to you.[A][X]

[ml][ToggleSmile]
Hey.[....] Lost in thought?[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]

[mr][ToggleSmile][OpenEyes][MoveMidRight]
Ah![AN]
...Mm.[....] You caught me, I suppose.[AN]

[ml]
You'll still have us, you know?[....][n]
Your dad isn't your only family.[AN]

[mr]
...I'm trying not to let those thoughts[n]
distract me.[AN]
We've enough to worry about already,[n]
being in a place like this.[AN]

[ml]
Good call.[....] Let's practice a bit while[n]
we've still got some peace and quiet.[AN]

[mr]
Hey![....] You two wanna[n]
give us a hand?[A][X]
